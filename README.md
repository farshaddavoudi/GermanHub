# German Language Learning Hub

## Overview
This is a project focused on creating German language resources through Anki flashcards, starting from scratch and following a step-by-step roadmap for gradual learning. The aim is to develop an accessible and systematic way for learners to master German vocabulary and grammar from scratch.

## Core Features
- **Anki Flashcards**: Each card includes the most educational content to ensure effective learning and retention.
- **Step-by-Step Progression**: Starts with essential German verbs and evolves gradually based on a clear roadmap starting from zero.

## Roadmap
1. **A1 Level**
    - [Top 100 German Verbs](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/609348355): 100 most common German Verbs that someone learning the language should know
    - Menschen A1.1 book
2. **A2 Level**

## Tags

- `german-A1-level`: Flashcards for vocabulary and grammar suitable for A1-level learners.
- `german-A2-level`: Flashcards for vocabulary and grammar suitable for A2-level learners.
- `german-top-100-verbs`: Tag for the flashcards covering the 100 most essential German verbs.
- `german-menschen-a1.1`, `german-menschen-a1.2`, etc.: Tags for vocabulary and grammar derived from specific textbooks or resources.
